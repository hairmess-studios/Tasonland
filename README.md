Installation will be on a seperate webpage and this is just the source code for the game. I have recently deleted my unity licence however as I am so used to unity with 3-4 years of experiance as of Sunday the 31st of December writing this at 22:55 (nearly 2024!)
This will be updated as soon as a download is avaliable however feel free to download the source code and compile your own save however it may contain bugs.
